# Redis Cache Demo Project


## Overview
This project demonstrates how caching with Redis can significantly reduce the response time of a REST API. By caching frequently requested data, we can reduce the load on the primary data source and improve the performance of the application.


## Features
- REST API endpoints for fetching data.
- Integration with Redis for caching.
- Measurement of response time with and without caching.
- Easy setup and configuration.


## Prerequisites
1. Node.js
2. npm (Node Package Manager)
3. Redis server
4. axios


## API End-Points
- https://github.com/nnishantparashar/redis-cache-demo/blob/main/rest.http


## Acknowledgments
- Redis - for providing a powerful caching solution.
- Express - for the web framework used.
